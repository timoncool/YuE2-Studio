//! The engine and the assistant sidecar are separate processes. Dropping their
//! supervisor kills them politely, but a supervisor does not always get to
//! run: a hard kill of the studio, a crash, a taskkill from the task manager -
//! and `yue-server` is left holding the GPU with nobody to talk to it.
//!
//! Windows answers this with a job object carrying
//! `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`: every child spawned into it dies when
//! the last handle to the job closes, which the system does for us when this
//! process ends, however it ends.
//!
//! Linux has no job objects. There the answer is `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`, set in the
//! forked child before it execs; see `configure_child_process` in
//! `music-engine`'s `yue_server`. This module's `adopt` therefore does nothing
//! off Windows - it is the spawn-side hook, not this one, that keeps a Linux
//! engine from being orphaned.
